# Zephyr exit() Function Usage

This document explains the usage of Zephyr's `exit()` function for error handling, validation, shutdown procedures, exit code documentation, and best practices.

---

## Overview

The `exit()` function allows you to terminate program execution immediately, optionally providing an exit code. This is useful for critical errors, validation failures, and graceful shutdowns.

---

## Introduction to exit() Function

**Description:**  
Terminate the program with a specific exit code for error reporting or shutdown.

```zephyr
exit(10)  # Terminates program with exit code 10
```

---

## Configuration Validation with Exit Codes

**Description:**  
Validate configuration and terminate if required settings are missing.

```zephyr
config = none
if config == none {
    print("Missing config")
    exit(11)
}
```

---

## System Resource Validation and Critical Error Handling

**Description:**  
Check system resources and exit on critical failures.

```zephyr
resources = {"db": none}
if resources["db"] == none {
    print("Critical: DB unavailable")
    exit(20)
}
```

---

## Business Logic Validation and Compliance Checking

**Description:**  
Enforce business rules and exit on violations.

```zephyr
user = {"age": 15}
if user["age"] < 18 {
    print("User too young")
    exit(30)
}
```

---

## Class System Integrity Validation

**Description:**  
Validate class system state and exit on integrity errors.

```zephyr
class System {
    func validate() {
        if this.status != "ok" {
            print("System error")
            exit(40)
        }
    }
}
sys = System()
sys.status = "fail"
sys.validate()
```

---

## Async System Validation and Error Recovery

**Description:**  
Use exit in async functions for critical error recovery.

```zephyr
async func check(val) {
    if val == none { exit(50) }
    return val
}
await check(none)
```

---

## Graceful Shutdown Patterns and Cleanup Procedures

**Description:**  
Perform cleanup and terminate the program gracefully.

```zephyr
func shutdown() {
    print("Cleaning up...")
    exit(59)
}
shutdown()
```

---

## Exit Code Documentation and Standardization

**Description:**  
Standardize exit codes for error reporting and monitoring.

- 10–19: Configuration errors
- 20–29: System resource errors
- 30–39: Business logic errors
- 40–49: Class system integrity errors
- 50–59: Async system errors and shutdown

---

## Best Practices for exit() vs try/catch

**Description:**  
Use exit for unrecoverable errors; use try/catch for recoverable exceptions.

- Use `exit()` for unrecoverable errors or required termination.
- Use `try/catch` for recoverable errors and exception handling.

---

## Real-World Scenarios

**Description:**  
Apply exit in practical error handling and monitoring contexts.

```zephyr
if not is_valid(user) {
    print("Invalid user")
    exit(15)
}
```

---

## Production-Level Error Handling and Monitoring Integration

**Description:**  
Integrate exit codes with external monitoring and reporting systems.

```zephyr
func monitor_error(code) {
    print("Reporting error code:", code)
    exit(code)
}
monitor_error(22)
```
