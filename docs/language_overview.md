- **Arithmetic Operators:** Perform calculations with numbers and strings; supports negative values.
- **String Multiplication:** Easily repeat strings for formatting and patterns.
- **Lists & Dictionaries:** Flexible collections for storing and manipulating data.
- **Functions & Lambdas:** Define reusable code blocks and anonymous functions; supports async and const parameters.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Create classes and objects for structured, modular code.
- **Control Flow:** Direct program execution with conditionals, switches, and loops.
- **Error Handling:** Catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Write non-blocking code with async/await and parallel execution.
- **Advanced Assignment:** Update values in-place with compound operators and increment/decrement.
- **Optional Chaining:** Safely access nested properties and indexes, avoiding errors on `none`.
- **Functional Programming:** Use map, filter, reduce, and higher-order functions for concise data processing.
- **Pipe Operator:** Chain function calls for readable, linear data flow.
- **Membership & Nullish Coalescing:** Test for membership and provide defaults only for `none`.

## Practical Examples

### Variables and Typing

```zephyr
x = 10                # Dynamic integer
y : float = 2.5       # Explicit float
name : string = "Alice"
flag : bool = true
const pi : float = 3.14159
```

### Lists and Dictionaries

```zephyr
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
info = {"name": "Zephyr", "version": 1.0}
users = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": [95, 87]},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": [88, 91]}
]
```

### Arithmetic, Comparison, and Logical Operators

```zephyr
sum = x + y
is_greater = x > y
neg = -x
flag = true and false
result = not flag
value = x > 5 or y < 10
```

### String Multiplication and Concatenation

```zephyr
border = "=" * 40
repeat = 3 * "Hi"
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += " World"
greeting *= 2
```

### Functions and Lambdas

```zephyr
func add(a, b) { return a + b }
square = x -> x * x
power = (base, exp) -> {
    result = 1
    for i = 1; i <= exp; i++ { result *= base }
    return result
}
```

### Classes and Objects

```zephyr
class Person {
    func init(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age }
    func greet() { return "Hello, " + this.name }
}
p = Person("Alice", 25)
print(p.greet())
```

### Control Flow

```zephyr
if x > 5 { print("x is large") } else { print("x is small") }
switch x {
    case 10: print("Ten"); break
    case 20: print("Twenty")
    default: print("Other")
}
for i = 0; i < 3; i++ { print(i) }
while x < 20 { x += 1 }
loop { print("Infinite loop"); break }
```

### Error Handling

```zephyr
try { risky = 10 / 0 } catch e { print("Error:", e) }
```

### Asynchronous Programming

```zephyr
async func fetch_data(url) { return "Data from " + url }
result = await fetch_data("http://example.com")
promise = spawn fetch_data("http://example.com")
results = await all([promise])
```

### Compound Assignment and Increment/Decrement

```zephyr
x += 5; x -= 2; x *= 3; x /= 2; x %= 4
count++; ++count; count--; --count
scores[0] += 10
info["version"] += 1.0
```

### Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing

```zephyr
profile = none
profile?.score += 10
name = user?.profile?.name ?? "Guest"
```

### Functional Programming

```zephyr
numbers = [1,2,3]
doubled = map(numbers, x -> x * 2)
evens = filter(numbers, x -> x % 2 == 0)
total = reduce(numbers, (a, b) -> a + b, 0)
compose = (f, g) -> x -> f(g(x))
```

### Pipe Operator

```zephyr
result = value |> func1 |> func2
```

### Destructuring Assignment

```zephyr
[a, b] = [1, 2]
[x, y, z] = [3, 4, 5]
```

### Unicode and Emoji Support

```zephyr
emoji_line = "ðŸš€" * 5
print(emoji_line)  # "ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"
```
